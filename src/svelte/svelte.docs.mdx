### Overview

This environment provides support for creating [Svelte components](https://svelte.dev/) as Bit components. Use this to create and share re-usable ui components written with svelte.

## Create a new workspace using a template

This environment comes with a built in basic workspace template for Svelte components. To use it run:
```sh
bit new svelte my-svelte-workspace --env feux.components/svelte
```
(note: `my-svelte-workspace` could be any name you choose for your workspace).

`cd` to the project directory and open the `workspace.jsonc` to configure the workspace to your liking.

Create your first component:

```sh
bit create svelte my-component
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```sh
bit install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
bit start
```

## Svelte component compositions

## Adding Svelte templates to an existing Bit workspace

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  /**
   * Add Svelte component generators to list of available component templates.
   **/
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "feux.components/svelte"
    ]
  }
},
```  

The above line adds the svelte env's templates for scaffolding new svelte components (and custom svelte envs) using `bit`'s templates feature for creating new components which are pre-populated with skeleton
code. Components created using templates added via this env will automatically have this env assigned as their env (so if you run `bit create svelte` the new component will have `feux.components/svelte` 
assigned as its env).

Now when you run `bit templates` you'll see the svelte template options and can use them via the `bit create` command.
